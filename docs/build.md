## Build your project on rc or prod server
###Keep in mind that build command is under development and might not work as expected!  
Use command without any flag to build from **origin/develop** branch (for example 
on test or rc sever)
```
ins build
```
Use command with **-p** flag to build from **origin/master** branch (for example 
prod sever)
```
ins build -p
```
